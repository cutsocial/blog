I’m currently a PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience at [xCIT Lab](http://xcit.org/) of [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/) and [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.mpg.de/149614/kognition_neuro). I study neural basis of how we learn and whether it can be improved by playing action video games.

I've been a <a href="http://github.com/morteza" target="_blank">computer scientist</a> most of my adult life. I've worked for several IT research institutes and startups as research engineer or senior software engineer, but I’m currently focusing on computational cognitive neuroscience.
