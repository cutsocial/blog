I’m currently a graduate student in Cognitive Neuroscience at xCIT Lab of University of Luxembourg and Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany. I've worked for several IT research institutes and startups as research/senior software engineer, but I’m currently focusing on behavioral neuroscience.

I have been a <a href="http://github.com/morteza" target="_blank">computer scientist</a> most of my adult life but not the weird and recluse kind. I like surreal arts, people, Dostoevsky, and Kurt Vonnegut.

I received my MS.c. in Cognitive Psychology from Institute for Cognitive Science Studies under supervision of Dr. Javad Hatami and conducted my thesis research at the Cognitive Lab at the University of Tehran, Iran. Prior to that, I studied Computer Engineering and AI.
