I’m currently a graduate student in Cognitive Neuroscience at [xCIT Lab](http://xcit.org/) of [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/) and [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.mpg.de/149614/kognition_neuro). I study neural basis of how we learn to learn, and how it can be improved. I've worked for several IT research institutes and startups as research engineer or senior software engineer, but I’m currently focusing on behavioral neuroscience.

I've been a <a href="http://github.com/morteza" target="_blank">computer scientist</a> most of my adult life but not the weird and recluse kind. I like surreal arts, people, Jazz, Dostoevsky, Hygge, and Kurt Vonnegut.

I received my MS.c. in Cognitive Psychology from Institute for Cognitive Science Studies and conducted my thesis research at the Cognitive Lab (Dr. Javad Hatami) at the University of Tehran. Prior to that, I studied Computer Engineering and AI, at [http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/~ansarinia](Tehran Polytechnic) and [http://en.sbu.ac.ir/](SBU).
