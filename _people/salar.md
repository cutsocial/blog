I am a cognitive scientist. I study how people make sense of their social world, how they categorize humans and things, and the role of beliefs about categories in everyday life. I am also interested societal functions of religious practices and beliefs, specifically focusing on the impact of fasting and abstinence on self-control and risk-taking.

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the [Kahneman-Treisman Center for Behavioral Science & Public Policy](https://behavioralpolicy.princeton.edu/people/mostafa-salari-rad) at the Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University. I received my Ph.D in Cognitive, Social and Developmental Psychology from the New School for Social Research, under supervision of Dr. Jeremy Ginges. Prior to that, I studied computer science and business.
