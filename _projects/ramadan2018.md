# Motivation
Prior research has shown that people's cognitive abilities and decision behavior change systematically when critical resources are perceived to be scarce (Mullainathan & Shafir, 2013). However, the majority of this work has been focused on a type of scarcity that is outside people's control, has uncertain duration, and involves financial resources (Shah, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2012). Alternatively, when practicing Muslims refrain from eating and drinking between sunrise and sunset for the entire month of Ramadan, they experience a form of scarcity that is self-inflicted, temporary, and specific to food and water. This provides a natural setting to investigate several interesting research questions. Namely, studying religious fasting could tell us whether scarcity effects are source immune, and persist regardless of how scarcity comes about (e.g. self vs. circumstance). Moreover, unlike other forms of scarcity that have no clear end in sight, fasting has a specific trajectory. Fasters know they can consume food and water as soon as sunset begins (provided food is available). As such, studying fasters could shed light on whether scarcity effects are robust to temporal constraints (e.g. temporary vs. chronic).

Another relevant construct is self-control. On the one hand, when people fast, their self-control abilities are highly engaged. On the other hand, scarcity has been shown to impair cognitive abilities, including self-control (Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir, & Zhao, 2013). This creates an interesting puzzle, where a task simultaneously activates self-control and also impairs it. Scarcity-induced cognitive effects could be exacerbated or diminished by fasting; it is also unclear whether scarcity and self-control in the context of food spill over onto other domains. Moreover, recent theorizing on psychology of poverty purports that decision patterns associated with poor people are in fact adaptive responses to perceived lack of control over the future events (Pepper & Nettle, 2017). To the extent that fasting can be viewed as a self-inflicted and temporary form of scarcity, study of changes in fasters’ decisions could test whether perceived control is a critical factor in shaping decisions patterns under scarcity (Rad & Ginges, 2017).

The reasoning above suggests that studying fasting could contribute to our understanding of cognition under conditions of scarcity. However, as a ritual practiced by over a billion Muslims every year for entire months, fasting is interesting in its own right. Most religions have self-deprivation practices, where people refrain from certain activities for certain durations. This is especially the case in Abrahamic religions, which believe in single, omniscient, and moralizing deity. Current work on origin of religious belief and its role in social and political settings purports that world religions played an important role in expansion of large scale cooperative societies and growth of community size (Henrich et al., 2010; Norenzayan et al., 2016). These so called Big God religions provide codes and sanctions of conduct and systems of rewards and punishment that promote cooperation-enhancing norms beyond network of kin (Purzycki et al., 2016). Essential to this functions is self-control, which is a salient aspect of religious fasting. Adopting the self-control as a muscle metaphor, we could expect people to perform better on tasks requiring self-control after 30 days of fasting. If this prediction holds, Ramadan could be construed as a month-long religious ritual that enhances norms of group living which require self-control.
Fasting could also generate proximate benefits at individual levels. In essence, fasting is a practice in delayed gratification, whereby a person chooses to forgo immediate consumption in exchange for a larger reward, to be bestowed later by an omnipotent creator. Fasting could potentially alleviate subpar decisions resulting from chronic scarcity by allowing attribution of scarcity to the self and internal causes, rather than external sources and circumstances beyond one’s control. While this hypothesis needs empirical testing, the negative correlation between religious belief and socioeconomic status corroborates the reasoning that there could be adaptive benefits to fasting at individual and collective levels (Gallup, 2010). That is, poorer people could benefit more from religious belief not merely through what religious institutions offer (e.g. hope, coherence, purpose, etc), and the communal aspects of religion (e.g. church, family, norm setters), but also via some type of cognitive route that mitigates the tunneling effect of immediate pressing needs.

Poverty is associated with negative affect and stress, which have also been shown to influence risk and time preferences. Stress has been shown to make people are more risk averse and less likely to invest in risky prospects, and it increases their discount rates of future (Haushofer & Fehr, 2014). Other research has shown that religion offers strategies to cope with stress (Ano & Vasconcelles, 2005; Winter et al., 2009). Based on these two lines of research, to the extent that religion is salient during Ramadan, its coping benefits should be at the forefront of everyday life. If so, we can expect a reduction in stress levels when people are fasting, and as a corollary, a decrease in stress-induced changes in decision-making.

Finally, dealing with hunger is daily challenge for poor people with deeply troubling effects. However, hunger while fasting is out of a commitment, a self-choice, and has no definite bearing on the person’s financial situation. Whether or not commitment can overcome or influence the negative consequences of hunger differently for the rich and poor is another interesting research question that could be explored by research proposed here. 

# Research Design
We have correlational evidence that fasters are more risk averse (Rad & Ginges, 2017). However, this could be due to endogenous factors since religiosity has also been found to correlate with risk aversion (Gao, Wang, & Zhao, 2017; Malinowski, 1925; Miller & Hoffmann, 1995). In this study we aim to examine this possibility by adopting a within-subject design. Using cognitive and decision making tasks, we will compare people’s performances when they are fasting to when they are not fasting. This narrows down the range of explanations for any variation in performances to fasting. 

## Subjects
Subjects will be pre recruited from Rutgers University students. Kaiser Aslam, the Muslim Chaplain of Rutgers University (here) is our contact person there.


## Procedure & Tool
We will use Cut, a platform developed to run interactive behavioral and decision making tasks (See example here). We will collect information on 4 different days, roughly 2 weeks apart. In the first round, participant will receive an email from the Muslim Chaplain at Rutgers University. The email contains a link to the first survey. Consenting participants will be required to specify a preferred means of contact (email, SMS, etc) for follow up surveys and payments. Responses to specific items will be stored separately and hash encrypted to prevent identification or respondents. At the end of the study respondents’ contact will be permanently deleted.


## Timeline
Ramadan 2018 begins on May 15 and ends on June 15. We will collect data twice on 4 days. The first day will be pre Ramadan, the two mid month days will fall during Ramadan, the last data collection day will be after Ramadan. Sunset will be between 8:08 (May 15, 2018) and 8:30 (June 15, 2018). See table below.

Introduction
Welcome!
This study is part of a research project on decision making, conducted by researchers at Rutgers University (IRB XX) and Princeton University (IRB XX.). Before you begin, please take note of a few things. 

First, you will be compensated for your participation in two ways: You will receive a flat fee of $X just for completing all tasks. In addition, you will receive points based on the quality of your responses. These points determine your chances of winning a prize of $Y in a raffle. We are only interested in your performance on the tasks, and will not ask questions that require specific knowledge or expertise. As long as you follow the instructions, your bonuses should be on the higher end.

Second, there are 3 similar but shorter surveys that will be sent out every two weeks. Participation fee on those surveys will be even higher, and your performance points on different surveys will accumulate, increasing your chances of winning the raffle prize. So look out for the invite emails.

Lastly, your responses on specific items will be anonymous. We ask for your email address to invite you to take part in the follow up surveys, and contact you for payments (i.e. emails can only tell us whether you completed the task, how many points you accumulated). 

If all this sounds good, please enter your email below to begin. Please send any questions or comments to mrad@princeton.edu

BART
We start with a game. In each round of this game, a tiny balloon in the center is inflated every time you press the ‘PUMP’ button. Each pump gives you a point as long as the balloon does not explode. If it does explode, you lose all your points in that round. At any point that you don’t want to pump the balloon any more, you can press the ‘SAVE' button to save your points and go to the next round. You will play a total of 20 rounds.

Press ‘Next’ to begin.

Go-NoGo
Thanks for finishing the first task. Now, let’s move another task where you have to react to different shapes as fast as you can, and as accurately as you can.

You will see a shape on the left or right side of the screen for a very short period of time and then it disappears. If the shape was a flower, press on the side it appeared; if you saw a heart, press on the opposite side. The goal is to be response as accurately and as fast as possible. 

Let’s play a few practice round to get you familiar with the task.

Notes
Practice round: 10 trials.
Main round: 2 blocks, 20 trials each
The mapping between heart/flower and same/opposite side should be counterbalanced across participants.

Delay Discounting
Now, let’s focus on a different task. Here you will make a series of choices between hypothetical present and future money rewards. Your task is to click on the reward you would prefer. 

We are interested in your real and spontaneous preferences. Please do not think too much about the individual choices and respond as fast as possible.

Press ‘Next’ to begin.

Dice Roll
We are almost done. This final taks is a simple dice roll task.

In each round, you roll two dice, giving one to yourself and one to another person. However, you have to decide in advance, before you roll the dice, which dice (left or right) goes to you and which goes the other person. Once you’ve decided which die goes to whom in you mind, you roll the dice and then allocate them.
