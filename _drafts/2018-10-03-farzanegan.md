Prior research has shown that people's cognitive abilities and decision behavior change systematically when critical resources are perceived to be scarce (Mullainathan & Shafir, 2013). However, the majority of this work has been focused on a type of scarcity that is outside people's control, has uncertain duration, and involves financial resources (Shah, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2012). Alternatively, when practicing Muslims refrain from eating and drinking between sunrise and sunset for the entire month of Ramadan, they experience a form of scarcity that is self-inflicted, temporary, and specific to food and water. This provides a natural setting to investigate several interesting research questions. Namely, studying religious fasting could tell us whether scarcity effects are source immune, and persist regardless of how scarcity comes about (e.g. self vs. circumstance). Moreover, unlike other forms of scarcity that have no clear end in sight, fasting has a specific trajectory. Fasters know they can consume food and water as soon as sunset begins (provided food is available). As such, studying fasters could shed light on whether scarcity effects are robust to temporal constraints (e.g. temporary vs. chronic).
